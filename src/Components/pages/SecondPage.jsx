                            This day was chaotic for both of us. I spent the whole day saving my battery so I could stay in touch with you for our meetup.
                            You were busy with your academics and thought I was upset because you were going to be late(nya ako gihapoy uwahi naabot :{'>'}).
                            Despite everything, we still managed to see each other.
